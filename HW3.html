    <h1>In this project I learned how to display images in different projections</h1>
    <h2>Using the World Projection maps and the Indicatrix mapper tool, I was able to show how different projections distort certain properties of a map while mainting others. To do this, I clicked the projection in the bottom right of the screen in QGIS and searched for the projection I wanted to display. Then, the map shapefile and Indicatrix tool change to match the new projection and show how the world looks using that projection.  </h2>
