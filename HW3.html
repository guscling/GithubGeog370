    <h1>August Clingroth GEOG 370 HW3</h1>
    <h1>In this project I learned how to display images in different projections</h1>
    <h5>Using the World Projection maps and the Indicatrix mapper tool, I was able to show how different projections distort certain properties of a map while mainting others. To do this, I clicked the projection in the bottom right of the screen in QGIS and searched for the projection I wanted to display. Then, the map shapefile and Indicatrix tool change to match the new projection and show how the world looks using that projection. </h5>

    <h5>This projection is widely used and while it maintains the shape of the land masses well it distorts the size, enlarging the land around the poles. Anarctica is especaily distorted, and is far laeger than it is on a globe and is massive in comparison to other land on the map. </h5>

    <h5>This projection uses an oval shape to prevent too much distorition. However, there is slight enlargement at the poles and vertica; stretching at the edges of the model</h5>

    <h5>This projection stretches the map horizontally in northern and southern hemisphere but maintains the same size</h5>

    <h5>This projection uses a semi-circular shape that keeps most of the world mostly true to size and shape at the expense of Antarctica which is completely enlongated and mishapen, as is some of the land closer to the poles, like Southern South America and Australia.</h5>

    <h5>This is similar to the last projection except that it uses a fully circualr shape instead. It has some of the same problems although it is slighly more distorted further north of Antarctica which is slightly more noticable in Argentina and Australia. There don't seem to be any benefits to using this projection versis the Conic one except that has a more accurate space of countries around the arcticle circle, which affects both the spacing and direction of those countries </h5>

    <h5>This projection is similar to the last one except it displays the globe with the South pole at the center rathern than the North pole. This gives an accurate shape and presumably size of Antarctica and the land near it but heavily distorts anything above the Equator in every possible way</h5>

    <h5>This projection does a good job of hiding significant distortion by distorting the shape of the countires across the globe evenly. Towards the equator, the land is lengthened vertically and towards the poles it is more horizontal. The projection also enlargens the poles somewhat, but not nearly as much as the pseudo mercator projection </h5>
