    <h1>August Clingroth GEOG 370 HW3</h1>
    <h1>In this project I learned how to display images in different projections</h1>
    <h5>Using the World Projection maps and the Indicatrix mapper tool, I was able to show how different projections distort certain properties of a map while mainting others. To do this, I clicked the projection in the bottom right of the screen in QGIS and searched for the projection I wanted to display. Then, the map shapefile and Indicatrix tool change to match the new projection and show how the world looks using that projection. </h5>

    <h5>This is the Pseudo Mercator projection. It is widely used and while it maintains the shape of the land masses well it distorts the size, enlarging the land around the poles </h5>
