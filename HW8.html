	<h3>Map Comparing the Original and Wpdated Chernobyl Exclusion Zones</h3>
    <img src="HW8/HW8.2.png" alt="Web map" width="700px" heigh="800px">
	<p>I chose to compare the original, circular 30km Chernobyl Exclusion Zone to the Exclusion zone that exists today. What I wanted to see was what was what areas were removed between the existence of the two. I fist marked the site of the disaster and created a 30km buffer around the point to represent the original zone. The current zone is broken up into two parts: The Chernobyl Exclusion Zone in Ukraine and the Polesie State Radiological Reserve in Belarus. I found a Geojson from OSM that represented the Chernoble Exclusion Zone and had to use a tool in QGIS, QuickOSM to import the Radiological Reserve. I made a union of the two to create one shapefile representing the entire zone then used the difference function to highlight the areas that are in the original area but not the current one.

	<h3>Links</h3>
    <p>As a note, I can't link to the data I got from the plugin and the other data can't be directly linked to so I will link to the website. I had to search Chernobyl Exclusion Zone (it takes a minute) and download the data. The coordinates of the Chernobyl meltdown I just looked up.</p>
