	<h3>Map Comparing the Original and Wpdated Chernobyl Exclusion Zones</h3>
    <img src="HW8/HW8.2.png" alt="Web map" width="700px" heigh="800px">
    <p>I chose to compare the original, circular 30km Chernobyl Exclusion Zone to the Exclusion zone that exists today. What I wanted to see was what areas were removed between the existence of the two. I first marked the site of the disaster and created a 30km <b>buffer</b> around the point to represent the original zone. The current zone is broken up into two parts: The Chernobyl Exclusion Zone in Ukraine and the Polesie State Radiological Reserve in Belarus. I found a Geojson from OSM that represented the Chernoble Exclusion Zone and had to use a tool in QGIS, QuickOSM to import the Radiological Reserve. I made a <b>union</b> of the two to create one shapefile representing the entire zone then used the <b>difference</b> function to highlight the areas that are in the original area but not the current one.</p>

	<h3>Links</h3>
    <p>As a note, I can't link to the data I got from the plugin of the Radiological Reserve, however I linked the OSM website that has a Geojson download of it that I chose not to use. The Exclusion zone vector data can't be directly linked to so I will link to the website I got it from. I had to search Chernobyl Exclusion Zone (it takes a minute) and download the data. I will also link a Geojson download for the Exclusion zone. The coordinates of the Chernobyl meltdown I just looked up. </p>
