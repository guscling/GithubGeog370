<h1>Homework 6: Census data choropleth </h1>
<h2>August Clingroth</h2>
<h3>My map shows the percentage of commuters older than 16 in Missouri, broken up by county, who commute to work with carpooling. Because it is proportional and not the total number of commuters, the highly populated counties around big cities like St. Louis and Kansas City have lower percentages than some more rural counties.</h3>
